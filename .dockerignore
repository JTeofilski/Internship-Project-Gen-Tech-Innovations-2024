# If we donâ€™t need the files to run the app without Docker, we do not need the files to run the app with Docker.
Dockerfile

docker-compose.yml

# Unlike Dockerfile, the app does need .env in order to run properly, both when using Docker and without using Docker. 
# However, if we are using a docker-compose.yml file, like we are in this app, and in the yml file we define an env_file, 
# then the .env file can be ignored.
